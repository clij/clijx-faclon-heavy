# CLIJx faCLon heavy
The faCLon heavy project will bring multi-GPU support for processing large images tile-by-tile. It is based on [imglib2](https://github.com/imglib), [n5](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/n5) and [CLIJ](https://clij.github.io).
It is the back-end for a user-interface to be built in the future. 
Thus, in order to use it right now, you need Java programming skills.

Work in progress.

# Usage
In order to use multiple GPUs, you need to define a [CLIJxPool](https://github.com/clij/clijx-faclon-heavy/blob/master/src/main/java/net/haesleinhuepf/clijx/faclonheavy/CLIJxPool.java) by configuring which GPU can hold how many CLIJx instances at a time.
For example, Intel integrated GPUs can typically hold a single OpenCL context only while dedicated AMD and NVidia cards
allow processing in multiple contexts at a time. If executed workflows and processed tiles are small enough so that 
multiple tiles can be processed in parallel on such dedicated GPUs, you can configure to do so:

```
CLIJxPool pool = CLIJxPool.fromDeviceNames(
            new String[]{"Intel(R) UHD Graphics 620", "RTX"},
            new int[]{                             1,     4});
System.out.println("CLIJ pool size: " + pool.size());
System.out.println("CLIJ pool: \n" + pool.log());
```
Output:
```
CLIJ pool size: 5
CLIJ pool: 
 * GeForce RTX 2080 Ti[net.haesleinhuepf.clijx.CLIJx@59d4cd39]
 * GeForce RTX 2080 Ti[net.haesleinhuepf.clijx.CLIJx@389c4eb1]
 * GeForce RTX 2080 Ti[net.haesleinhuepf.clijx.CLIJx@3fc79729]
 * GeForce RTX 2080 Ti[net.haesleinhuepf.clijx.CLIJx@34f6515b]
 * Intel(R) UHD Graphics 620[net.haesleinhuepf.clijx.CLIJx@4b34fff9]
```

Furthermore, you need to define your workflow as class implementing [TileProcessor](https://github.com/clij/clijx-faclon-heavy/blob/master/src/main/java/net/haesleinhuepf/clijx/faclonheavy/TileProcessor.java). 
To keep things simple, extend your workflow from [AbstractTileProcessor](https://github.com/clij/clijx-faclon-heavy/blob/master/src/main/java/net/haesleinhuepf/clijx/faclonheavy/AbstractTileProcessor.java).
An example is provided as [DummyFilter](https://github.com/clij/clijx-faclon-heavy/blob/master/src/main/java/net/haesleinhuepf/clijx/faclonheavy/implementations/DummyFilter.java), which basically is just a function:
```
@Override
public void accept(ClearCLBuffer input, ClearCLBuffer output) {
    // allocate temporary memory
    ClearCLBuffer temp = clijx.create(input);

    // process the image
    clijx.differenceOfGaussian(input, temp, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 5);
    clijx.thresholdOtsu(temp, output);

    // clean up
    temp.close();
}
```


```
int margin = 20;
final CLIJxFilterOp<FloatType, FloatType> clijxFilter =
        new CLIJxFilterOp<>(Views.extendMirrorSingle(floats), pool, DummyFilter.class, margin, margin, margin);

// make a result image lazily
final RandomAccessibleInterval<FloatType> filtered = Lazy.generate(
        img,
        new int[] {256, 256, 256},
        new FloatType(),
        AccessFlags.setOf(AccessFlags.VOLATILE),
        clijxFilter);
```

Here you can see the first execution(s) take a bit longer because of the warmup-effect in our case dominated by OpenCl-code just in time compilation ([see](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2008/2008.11799.pdf)).
Furthermore, you can see that different GPUs need more/less time for computing the new tile.
Last but not least, the processed image is larger than the requested tile-size because of the define margin around every tile.
For optimal performance, keep the tiles as large as possible and minimize the margin.
